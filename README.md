# Alfred Workflows (Optimzed for Alfred v4)
Alfred v4 Workflows. Here is a list of the **Alfred Workflows I use in my workflow**.
Most workflows are **made by me**. A few of them are based on work from others, in which case credits will be mentioned under "About this Workflow".

## Add To-Do to Things 3
*Based on the official culturedcode Quicksilver/Alfred script.*

![Alfred and Things 3 Screenshot](https://github.com/danielbahl/alfredv4/blob/master/Add-To-Do-to-Things-3-screenshot-1.png?raw=true)

### Getting started
**`+ Remember the milk`** creates a new TODO in inbox named "Remember the milk".

### Advanced Syntax

`title #tag1 #tag2 [project name/area name] ::note >duedate`

**Example:** `+ Remember the milk #groceries Shopping/Daily ::I love milk >20190616`

#### Notes
- Only existing tags can be added. This parameter is case-insensitive. If #tag1 doesn’t exist, '#tag1' will be added to the to-do’s title.
- To-dos can only be added to existing projects or areas. This parameter is case-insensitive. Projects or areas that don’t already exist will be ignored entirely; the text won’t be added to the to-do’s title.
- Format for the due date will reflect your Mac’s short date format. Check this in System Preferences > Language & Region > Advanced… > Dates. Invalid due date formats will result in the parameter’s text being added to the to-dos title.
- If you’re using a dark theme for Alfred, there’s a white Inbox icon available in this Workflow’s folder. Right-click the Workflow and click Show in Finder to find it.

## Bear
*Based on chrisbro/alfred-bear.*

## Emoji Search
*Based on James Sumners (jsumners/alfred-emoji) awesome work!* Optimized and edited a bit to fit my emoji needs :)

**Hotkey Enabled** Please note that this Workflow has the CMD+. hotkey enabled. So it's easy to find and insert emojis everywhere by using the keyboard shortcuts CMD + .(dot)

### Getting started
**`emo hello`** find emojis matching the search-term "hello". Press ENTER to copy it to clipboard or CMD+ENTER to insert it directly into the content you are working on.

## SMB Mounter + Unmounter Server

Fast mounting smb network share. Please also refer to https://support.apple.com/en-bw/HT208209 for speedier SMBs on your Mac. This script mounts/unmounts a network-share to your desktop.

#### Please change the IP, Sharename, Username and Password inside the Script to make this work. Also change notification and keyword to  fit your needs :) 🦄

## Royal TSX

This awesome workflow works together with Royal TSX enabling searching and connecting to remote servers from Alfred.

![royal tsx on alfred](https://github.com/danielbahl/alfredv4/blob/master/royal-tsx-screenshot-1.png?raw=true)

### Ad-hoc

`royal rdp://1.2.4.5` creates an ad-hoc remote desktop connection to IP 1.2.4.5.

`royal ssh://awesomeworkstation.com` creates an ad-hoc SSH connection to awesomeworkstation.com

`royal ftp://mywebsite.com` creates an ad-hoc FTP connection to your website.

### Search

`royal web01` search for web01 in your Royal Bookmarks. Press enter to open Royal TSX and connect.

### Direct Connections

Every morning I connect to a specific server, my workstation. That's why I've made a keyword called "workstation" that connects directly to a specific server in Royal. For this to work you'll need the UUID from Royal for this specific server. Therefore, I have made a Clipboard action that you can connecte the Royal keyword. Then use the Royal keywork to connect to the server, now you have the UUID in your clipboard. Now insert the UUID from your clipboard into the workstation workflow script. Sorry, I know it's a bit hacky. Hope to redo this soon :)

## Philips Hue

I'm using https://github.com/benknight/hue-alfred-workflow for my Hue needs :)

## Fake Data

I'm using Fakeum to generate fake data for testing purpose when I'm coding

## Resolve URL

I'm using Resolve URL by Dean Jackson

## Clipboard History

I know many who uses Alfred, but who are not using some of the smart awesome features that Alfred has built in, eg. Clipboard History. I have set my Clipboard history to CMD + ALT +. (Dot). If you don't use Clipboard History yet, enable now - you'll love it;)

Clipboard History also supports the iCloud Universal Clipboard Sharing from your iPhone, iPad and other Macs. It's awesome! ☁️😍
